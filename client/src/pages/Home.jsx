      <p>And for the election day page:</p>

      <h3>It's election day, what do I do?</h3>

      <p>That's easy, find your polling place and go vote!</p>

      <h4>What to expect</h4>

      <p>Your polling place, depending on how many people live in your area, is likely to have volunteers for candidates - or even the candidates themselves - handing out literature at a legally specified distance from the entrance. There will also be signs for the candidates on the ballot. No one is allowed to advocate for candidates or hand out literature inside the polling place.</p>

      <p>You may have to wait in a short line inside the polling place. At the front of the line will be a table with greeters who will take your name and verify your registration status. Beginning in 2020 in North Carolina, you will be required to show a valid, state-approved ID to vote. Please see <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/Voter-ID">this page</a> for more details about which IDs are approved for use and the form you can use to request a free North Carolina Voter ID (you must submit this form in person at your county Board of Elections office).</p>

      <p>In Guilford County, voters use electronic voting machines unless they request a provisional ballot or curbside voting accommodations. These machines are touch screen devices that will present the voter’s ballot page by page. As you touch candidate names to select them, the machine will record your choices on a piece of paper that looks like a receipt visible through a small window on the machine. You may change your selections at any point during the process until presented with a final screen to confirm the selections.</p>

      <p>If you need assistance at any time, you can and should request help from the individuals working at the polling place. If they refuse to assist you, please report this using the resources listed below.</p>

      <h4>How to report issues with your polling place</h4>

      <p>Intimidation and harassment at polling places is a violation of federal law. Make sure that you <a href="https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights/">know your rights!</a> If you encounter issues on election day, please utilize one of the following resources:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>U.S. Department of Justice Voting Rights Hotline: 800-253-3931; TTY line 877-267-8971</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/voting-accessibility">Department of Justice Election Complaint Report Form</a></li>
        <li>American Civil Liberties Union Voter Protection Hotline: 1-866-OUR-VOTE (1-866-687-8683) or 1-888-VE-Y-VOTA (1-888-839-8682) (en Español).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Accessibility & Accomodations</h4>

      <p>The Help America Vote Act of 2002 stipulated legal requirements for accommodations at all polling places nationwide to ensure that every voter can easily participate. Accommodations include allowing for physical assistance inside the voting booth or curbside voting, in which polling place volunteers help individuals cast a vote from their car. You may request these accommodations on Election Day. Please visit <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/voting/help-voters-disabilities">this page</a> for more details about North Carolina’s voter accessibility considerations.</p>
